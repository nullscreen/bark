BARK (Better App Reporting Kit) is a simple, in-app issue reporting library for iOS. Shaking the app pulls up an action sheet, where beta users can instantly send email or create GitHub issues.

## Get Started ##

1. Add it to your Podfile `pod 'Bark', '~> 0.1'` or clone the repository with `git clone git@github.com:stagebloc/bark.git` 
2. Link the following frameworks in the Build Phases tab: 
    - `MessageUI` - to send emails from within the app
    - `SystemConfiguration` -  for network reachability support
    - `Security` - for secure storage of GitHub credentials
3. In your `AppDelegate.m`, `#import "SBWindow.h"`
4. Finally, set `self.window` equal to the SBWindow subclass, as shown below - make sure to set `window.repositoryName` to the name of the repository you want to submit issues to.

```objc
// an example applicationdidFinishLaunchingWithOptions method
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    SBWindow *window = [[SBWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds]];
    window.repositoryName = @"stagebloc/bark";
    self.window = window;
    
    // Override point for customization after application launch.
    SBRootViewController *rootViewController = [[SBRootViewController alloc] init];
    self.window.rootViewController = rootViewController;
    
    self.window.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor];
    [self.window makeKeyAndVisible];
    return YES;
}
```

## Features ##

BARK comes with a set of features to make quick adjustments. You can set these below `repositoryName` on the window object.

```objc
// email
window.emailRecipients = @[@"hi@stagebloc.com", @"ratchet@stagebloc.com"];
window.emailSubject = @"Subject";
window.emailBody = @"Body"; // note that this will override sending device info
window.attachScreenshot = YES; // defaults to YES

// github
window.defaultAssignee = @"your_username";
window.defaultMilestone = @"milestone_title";
window.attachDeviceInfo = YES; // defaults to YES
```

### Coming Soon ###

Submitting images through the GitHub API is currently unsupported. We're planning to build a workaround to make this possible, so you'll soon be able to attach screenshots to GitHub issues as well.

## Using BARK in Production ##

BARK can now be used in production by implementing a simple callback.

1) Add the `SBWindowDelegate` to your `AppDelegate.h` file. 

```objc
#import "SBWindow.h"
@interface SBAppDelegate : UIResponder <UIApplicationDelegate, SBWindowDelegate>
```
2) Set the delegate property on your `SBWindow` instance in your `AppDelegate.m` file. Note that the property is called `windowDelegate` as opposed to `delegate`. This is to avoid interfering with the `delegate` property on the `UIWindow` superclass.

```objc
window.windowDelegate = self;
```
3) Implement the delegate method `shouldShowActionSheet`. You'll need to create your own way of determining whether or not the current user is an admin. We check against the logged in user's email address.

```objc
- (BOOL)shouldShowActionSheet
{
    /* add the logic to determine whether or not to show the action sheet. Something like:
     if([currentUser isAdmin]) {
        return YES;
     } else return NO;
    */
    return YES;
}
```
